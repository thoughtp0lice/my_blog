						In a meeting this Wednesday, Elon Musk, the new owner of twitter and self-declared “free speech absolutist”, told the advertisers he wanted Twitter to “be a force that moves civilization in a positive direction.” It seems that Must still wants people to believe he is the messiah that would save twitter and maybe the internet by bringing back free speech. In reality, he is becoming one of the largest threats to free speech on the internet.&hellip;

						I love Apple products. I truly do. When they works, Apple&rsquo;s devices are worth every penny I spend for them. However, when one of them broke, the price to repair made me question all my decisions in life. In Apple&rsquo;s own support service, replacing the battery of a iPhone14 would cost 99 dollars, and replacing the screen cost a shocking 279 dollars. To make sure the customers have to pay their ridiculous prices, Apple has been working hard to prevent individuals and third party repair shops from doing similar repairs by deliberately designing their product to be impossible to repair and taking legal actions to make important repair parts unavailable on the market.&hellip;

					<br><div class="description">
						
						Throughout history scientists have been fighting against the physical and mental barriers to build channels of communication. Back in 17th century, a priest by the name of Marin Mersenne established some of the earliest mathematical conferences and correspondences in Europe. He encouraged mathematicians working in the same field to share their findings and even smooth their relationships. With his communication network, mathematicians across Europe were able to build a community to push forward the boundary of human knowledge.&hellip;

						Han Zhong Stephen Mack Writing 340 15 October 2022
&ldquo;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&rdquo;, said Arthur C. Clarke, the famous science fiction writer. This statement is especially true in the field of artificial intelligence. In recent years, we have seen AI beating human champions at game of Go. We have seen them creating art and winning prizes. There&rsquo;s even an essay written by AI published on The Guardian, trying to convince us that &ldquo;robots come in peace&rdquo;.&hellip;

						To have complete control over their subject is the dream of all rulers through out history. Tighter control over people could mean better military power, stronger economy, and more stable society. More than 2000 years ago, when ancient China is dominated by the Seven Warring States， emperors of Qin state established a system that grouped households by 5. Each group must report any crimes committed by members of the group and failure to report crimes would result in execution of everyone in the group.&hellip;

					<time>Oct 1, 2022</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						In the 2017 documentary AlphaGo, the AI researchers at DeepMind complained that, the news media often associate their ground breaking AI Go player with killer robots like the Terminator. They think this association contributes to the public&rsquo;s irrational fear of their work on artificial intelligence. Their frustration is very understandable since DeepMind&rsquo;s AlphaGo couldn&rsquo;t be more different from the Terminator. For starters, AlphaGo doesn&rsquo;t look like Arnold Schwarzenegger and couldn&rsquo;t turn itself into liquid metal.&hellip;

						The Iranian government has been repeatedly shutting down the internet since September 19 in an effort to control the antigovernment protests. As crazy as it seems, it&rsquo;s not the first time such a restriction of internet connectivity happens. In fact, it has become quite a common practice for authoritarian regimes to limit internet access to counter a protest or a potential one. Last February, during the military coup in Myanmar, a decrease in local internet connectivity has been reported by many global internet traffic monitor.&hellip;

					<time>Sep 17, 2022</time>
					<br><div class="description">
						
						Since the 70s, the American public&rsquo;s confidence in news media and the government has been on a steady decline. It&rsquo;s almost natural that something like The Daily Show (TDS) would come out of this time of distrust to ridicule these rotting institutions. In the beginning when TDS just premiered at Comedy Central, it was a simple comedy show that uses news format only as a framing for the jokes. After the original host Craig Kilborn left the show in 1998, Comedy Central found Jon Stewart, at the time a leather-jacketed Gen X wisecracker famous for his hip MTV talk show, to take over.&hellip;
